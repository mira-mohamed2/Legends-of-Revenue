# Quick UI Changes Reference

## What Changed? ✨

### 🎭 Animations Added

- Character Manager modal scales in when opened

**Hover Effects**
- All buttons lift up slightly and show shadow
- Cards scale up (2%) and lift when you hover
- Stat badges in header lift on hover

### 📏 Spacing Improvements

**Before vs After**
```
Panels:     p-3 → p-4     (+33% padding)
Buttons:    py-1.5 → py-2 (+33% vertical)
Grid gaps:  gap-3 → gap-4 (+33% spacing)
Headers:    mb-2 → mb-3/4 (more breathing room)
```

**Specific Fixes**
- Character Manager: Moved from top-12 to top-14 (no overlap with button)
- MenuBar stats: Consistent px-3 py-1.5 padding
- Market tabs: Better spacing (py-2.5) for easier clicking
- Map cards: Improved padding (p-3) for cleaner look

### 🎨 Visual Polish

**Smooth Transitions**
- All animations use 300-500ms duration (not too fast, not too slow)
- Cubic-bezier easing for natural, smooth motion
- Consistent timing across entire app

**Enhanced Shadows**
- Panels: shadow-lg → shadow-xl on hover
- Buttons: Added shadow-md on hover
- Cards: Enhanced shadow (0 10px 20px) on hover

**Better Typography**
- Headings slightly larger where needed
- Icons sized better (text-3xl for location icons)
- Consistent font hierarchy

### ♿ Accessibility

**Focus States**
- 2px gold outline on all interactive elements
- Shadow ring for better visibility
- Works great with keyboard navigation

**Reduced Motion**
- Respects user's OS preference for reduced animations
- Animations become near-instant if user prefers less motion

**Custom Scrollbar** (Webkit browsers)
- Themed to match medieval aesthetic
- Brown thumb, parchment track
- Smooth hover transition
