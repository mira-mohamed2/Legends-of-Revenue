## Summary
‚úÖ **Complete lore reversal accomplished**  
‚úÖ **All text updated to reflect MIRA as heroes**  
‚úÖ **No gameplay mechanics affected**  
‚úÖ **No errors or breaking changes**  
‚úÖ **Game is fully playable with new narrative**

The game now tells the story of a MIRA Revenue Agent fighting tax evaders and recovering hidden assets, rather than a rebel fighting against MIRA. The irony of fighting for an organization named after the ultimate tax evader (the dragon) adds narrative depth!
