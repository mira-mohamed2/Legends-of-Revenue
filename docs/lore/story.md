# Legends of Revenue - MIRA Chronicles
## Official Game Lore

### Setting
The Maldives has long struggled with tax evasion, corruption, and financial crime. The **Maldives Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA)** was established to bring order, fairness, and justice to the taxation system. However, a shadow economy of tax evaders, fraudsters, and corrupt businessmen threatens the prosperity of the nation.

### Your Role
You are a **MIRA Revenue Agent** - an elite enforcer tasked with tracking down tax evaders, recovering hidden assets, and bringing financial criminals to justice. Armed with your investigative skills and combat prowess, you venture into the dark corners of society where tax evasion schemes flourish.

### The Good Guys (You and MIRA)
- **MIRA (Maldives Inland Revenue Authority)** - Your organization, dedicated to fair taxation and economic justice
- **Revenue Agents** - Elite investigators and enforcers (you!)
- **MIRA Director** - Your superior at MIRA Headquarters
- **Honest Citizens** - Law-abiding taxpayers who support your mission

### The Enemies (Tax Evaders)

#### Tax Dodger Rats
Small-time criminals who hoard coins and refuse to report their income. Even the lowest vermin try to evade MIRA's justice.

#### Petty Tax Evaders
Small-business owners and individuals who haven't filed taxes in years. They fight desperately to keep their ill-gotten gains rather than pay their fair share.

#### Offshore Accountants
Shady financial advisors who help wealthy clients hide money in offshore accounts and shell companies. Slippery and deceptive, they use complex schemes to evade detection.

#### Corrupted Businessmen
Wealthy merchants who bribe officials, falsify records, and run elaborate tax evasion schemes. They wear expensive suits but have cheap morals. These are the most dangerous criminals you'll face.

#### Arim the Dragon (Final Boss - Not yet implemented)
The legendary tax evader who inspired the name of your organization ironically. She hoards stolen wealth in her lair - money that rightfully belongs to the people of the Maldives. Defeating her would be the ultimate achievement for any Revenue Agent.

### The Philosophy
In this world, **taxation is not oppression - it's justice**. Tax evasion hurts society by:
- Depriving public services of funding
- Forcing honest citizens to pay more
- Creating unfair advantages for the wealthy
- Enabling corruption and crime

As a MIRA agent, you fight for:
- **Fairness** - Everyone paying their fair share
- **Justice** - Criminals held accountable
- **Prosperity** - A strong economy that benefits all citizens
- **Order** - Rule of law over chaos and greed

### Progression
- Start as a Tax Officer Trainee at MIRA Headquarters
- Investigate low-level tax dodgers in the Business District
- Progress to Tax Officer and then Senior Tax Officer roles
- Advance to Elite Enforcer and eventually Revenue Master
- Eventually face the ultimate challenge: Arim the Dragon herself

### The Irony
The greatest tax evader in history, **Arim the Dragon**, hoards wealth that could help the people. The organization named after her - **MIRA** - now fights against everything she represents. When you finally face her in the Dragon's Lair, you'll be fighting the embodiment of greed and tax evasion itself.
