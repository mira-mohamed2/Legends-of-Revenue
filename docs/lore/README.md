# 🏰 Legends of Revenue - Complete Game Lore

> *"In a world where shadows hide billions, one agency stands between order and economic chaos."*

---

## 📖 The Legend Begins

### Overview

In **Legends of Revenue**, you are not a rebel or a rogue. You are **justice incarnate**—a heroic agent of **MIRA** (Maldives Inland Revenue Authority), the last bastion of economic order in a world drowning in tax evasion and financial fraud.

This is a story of courage, duty, and the eternal struggle between those who serve the public good and those who serve only greed.

## � The World of MIRA

### The Maldives: Paradise Lost

Once a beacon of tropical prosperity, the Maldives has fallen into economic shadow. Corruption festers in high places. Offshore havens shelter billions in stolen wealth. The very foundations of society crumble as tax revenue—the lifeblood of civilization—hemorrhages into criminal coffers.

#### The Fallen Territories

**🏢 The Business District**
- *Status:* Compromised
- *Threat Level:* Moderate
- *Description:* Once-legitimate enterprises now falsify records, hide revenues, and bribe inspectors. Behind every office door lurks a petty tax evader, desperate to protect their ill-gotten gains.

**🌑 The Black Market**
- *Status:* Active Criminal Hub
- *Threat Level:* High
- *Description:* In the shadowed alleys where law fears to tread, forbidden trades flourish. Cash changes hands without receipts, goods move without manifests, and every transaction mocks the very concept of taxation.

**🛂 Border Checkpoints**
- *Status:* Infiltrated
- *Threat Level:* Critical
- *Description:* Where the nation should be protected, smugglers now reign. Contraband flows like water, and those sworn to guard the borders have become gatekeepers of corruption.

**🏝️ Offshore Havens**
- *Status:* Tax Evasion Fortress
- *Threat Level:* Extreme
- *Description:* Tropical islands transformed into financial bunkers. Shell companies nest like parasites, numbered accounts hide fortunes, and shady accountants weave webs of legal deception so complex that justice itself becomes lost.

**🏰 Shell Company Headquarters**
- *Status:* Enemy Stronghold
- *Threat Level:* Elite
- *Description:* The beating heart of corporate tax fraud. Here, corrupted businessmen command empires built on lies, protected by armies of lawyers and walls of paperwork.

**🐉 The Dragon's Lair**
- *Status:* Final Boss Arena
- *Threat Level:* LEGENDARY
- *Description:* At the pinnacle of corruption sits **Arim the Dragon**—the physical manifestation of tax evasion itself. Ancient, cunning, and hoarding mountains of untaxed wealth, this beast represents the ultimate challenge for any MIRA agent.
