## 🎭 The Story

### Overview

In **Legends of Revenue**, you play as a heroic agent of **MIRA** (Maldives Inland Revenue Authority), fighting to bring tax evaders to justice. This is not a story of rebellion - this is a story of justice, order, and protecting the revenue that serves the people.

The Maldives has fallen into economic chaos. Tax evaders run rampant, hiding in:
- 🏢 Business districts with shady accountants
- 🌑 Black market alleys where illegal trades flourish
- 🛂 Border checkpoints with smuggling operations
- 🏝️ Offshore havens protecting corrupt businessmen

### Your Role

You are a **MIRA Agent** - an enforcement officer dedicated to:
- Apprehending tax evaders
- Recovering hidden assets
- Dismantling offshore schemes
- Protecting national revenue

### The Journey

From humble beginnings at **MIRA Headquarters**, you'll:
1. Complete training missions
2. Hunt down petty evaders
3. Face corrupt businessmen
4. Challenge offshore accountants
5. Confront the ultimate threat: **Mira the Dragon**

This isn't about oppression - it's about **fairness** and **responsibility**.

### The Message

Every battle won:
- Returns stolen wealth to the people
- Protects honest citizens
- Strengthens the nation
- Brings justice to the corrupt
