# Combat Consumables Feature

## Overview
Players can now use consumable items (health potions, scrolls, etc.) during combat encounters to heal or gain other benefits.

## Implementation

### 1. **New PlayerStore Function: `useItem()`**
**File**: `src/state/playerStore.ts`

**Functionality**:
- Takes an `itemId` as parameter
- Checks if item exists in inventory
- Validates item is consumable category
- Applies item effect based on type
- Removes one item from inventory on successful use
- Returns `true` if successful, `false` if failed

**Supported Effect Types**:
- `heal` - Restores HP (currently implemented)
- `damage` - For future attack scrolls/bombs
- `buff` - For future buff potions

**Safety Checks**:
- Cannot use healing potions when at full HP
- Item must be in inventory
- Item must be consumable type

### 2. **Updated Combat View UI**
**File**: `src/features/combat/CombatView.tsx`

**New Features**:

  - Disabled when player is defeated
  - Visual feedback (hover effects, opacity)
- **Combat Log Integration** - Usage messages appear in combat log

**UI Design**:

## User Experience

### How to Use Consumables in Combat:

1. **Enter Combat** - Encounter an enemy
2. **Check Consumables** - Section appears below combat log (if you have any)
3. **Click Item** - Click a consumable to use it
4. **See Effect** - Combat log shows "Used [Item Name]! Restored X HP."
5. **Item Consumed** - Quantity decreases by 1

### Smart Features:

✅ **Can't waste healing potions** - Disabled at full HP  
✅ **Visual feedback** - Clear hover and disabled states  
✅ **Combat log integration** - All actions logged  
✅ **Quantity tracking** - Shows x[number] for each item  
✅ **Auto-hide** - Section only appears when you have consumables

## Example Combat Flow:

```
1. Player HP: 30/100
2. Player uses Greater Health Potion
3. Combat log: "Used Greater Health Potion! Restored 50 HP."
4. Player HP: 80/100
5. Greater Health Potion x2 → x1
6. Player attacks enemy
```

## Future Enhancements (Ready for Implementation)

### Attack Scrolls/Bombs:
```json
{
  "id": "fire-scroll",
  "name": "Fire Scroll",
  "category": "consumable",
  "effect": { "type": "damage", "value": 30 },
  "description": "Unleashes a burst of flames"
}
```

### Buff Potions:
```json
{
  "id": "strength-potion",
  "name": "Strength Potion",
  "category": "consumable",
  "effect": { 
    "type": "buff", 
    "stat": "attack", 
    "value": 5, 
    "duration": 3 
  },
  "description": "Increases attack for 3 turns"
}
```

### Status Effect Cures:
```json
{
  "id": "antidote",
  "name": "Antidote",
  "category": "consumable",

  "description": "Cures poison status"
}
```

## Technical Notes

### Effect System Design:
The `useItem()` function uses a switch statement for extensibility:
- Easy to add new effect types
- Each effect type has its own validation
- Returns boolean for UI feedback

### Combat Integration:
- Consumables can be used between player and enemy turns
- Usage doesn't trigger enemy attack
- Combat log provides clear feedback
- Item quantity updates in real-time

### Performance:
- Consumables filtered on render (lightweight operation)
- Only shows when inventory has consumables
- Minimal re-renders
