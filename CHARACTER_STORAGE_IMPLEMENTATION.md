# Character Storage System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. File-Based Character Storage
- Created `src/utils/characterStorage.ts` - Complete character management system
- Storage location: `Documents/Legends of Revenue/Characters/` (conceptual, using localStorage)
- Each character saved as individual JSON file with full data

### 2. Character Data Structure
- Created `src/types/player.ts` - PlayerStats and PlayerEquipment interfaces
- Created `src/types/inventory.ts` - InventorySlot interface
- Full character data includes:
  - Stats (level, XP, HP, gold, attack, defense)
  - Equipment (weapon, armor, accessory)
  - Inventory with all items
  - Current location
  - Enemies killed count
  - All visited locations
  - Avatar (default and custom)
  - Unlocked achievements

### 3. Import/Export Features

#### Export Functions
- **Export Current Character** - Save active character to `.json` file
- **Export All Characters** - Backup all saved characters in single file
- **Auto-naming** - Files named with username and date

#### Import Function
- **Import Character** - Load character from `.json` file
- **Conflict Detection** - Warns if character already exists
- **Smart Merging** - Option to overwrite or keep existing

### 4. Character Manager UI
- Created `src/components/CharacterManager.tsx`
- Floating **💾 Characters** button in top-right corner
- Features:
  - View all saved characters with stats
  - See level, gold, location, last saved time
  - Load/switch between characters
  - Export individual characters
  - Delete characters (with confirmation)
  - Import characters from files
  - Export all characters at once

### 5. Integration with Game
- Updated `src/state/playerStore.ts`:
  - `savePlayer()` now uses characterStorage
  - `loadPlayer()` supports new format
  - Backward compatibility with old localStorage
  - Auto-save on every action
  - Achievement restoration

### 6. Added to MenuBar
- Updated `src/components/MenuBar.tsx`
- Character Manager accessible from any screen
- Always visible for easy access

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `src/utils/characterStorage.ts` - Core storage system
2. `src/components/CharacterManager.tsx` - UI component
3. `src/types/player.ts` - Type definitions
4. `src/types/inventory.ts` - Type definitions
5. `CHARACTER_STORAGE.md` - Complete documentation

### Modified Files
1. `src/state/playerStore.ts` - Integrated with characterStorage
2. `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` - Added CharacterManager

### Key Features
- **Version Control** - Format version tracked for future migrations
- **Timestamps** - Last saved time recorded
- **Backward Compatible** - Falls back to old localStorage if new format not found
- **Dual Storage** - Saves to both new format and old localStorage
- **Achievements Included** - Full progress restoration

### Storage Keys
- Pattern: `character_{safe_username}`
- Example: `character_agent007`
- Safe naming: lowercase, alphanumeric, underscores only

2. **Character Sharing** - Share your build with friends
3. **Multi-Character** - Switch between multiple characters
4. **Safe Migration** - Move characters between devices
5. **Progress Protection** - Never lose your progress

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

- [x] Save character data
- [x] Load character data
- [x] Export current character
- [x] Import character file
- [x] Export all characters
- [x] List all characters
- [x] Delete character
- [x] Switch between characters

## 📖 Usage Tips

1. **Regular Exports** - Export your character before major updates
2. **Test Imports** - Try importing on a fresh character first
3. **Name Clearly** - Use descriptive character names
4. **Backup Often** - Export all characters weekly
5. **Share Wisely** - Include character info in shared files

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Browser localStorage has size limits (~5-10MB)
2. No automatic cloud backup (future feature)
3. No built-in character versioning (use exports)
4. Manual export required for backups
5. Trust-based for shared characters (no validation)

## 💡 Developer Notes

The system is designed to:
- Be simple and reliable
- Work offline
- Require no server
- Be human-readable (JSON)
- Allow manual editing (advanced users)
- Support future features (version system)

All character data is stored client-side for privacy and simplicity. Future versions may add cloud sync options.
