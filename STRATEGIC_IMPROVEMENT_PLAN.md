import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
import { getStorage } from 'firebase/storage';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: process.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: "legends-of-revenue.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "legends-of-revenue",
  storageBucket: "legends-of-revenue.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "...",

  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'basic' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  definition: string;
  example: string;
  realWorldApplication: string;
  unlockedBy: string; // quest or achievement
  relatedTerms: string[];
}

// Example
{
  id: 'progressive-taxation',
  name: 'Progressive Taxation',
  category: 'intermediate',
  definition: 'A tax system where the tax rate increases as income increases.',
  example: 'In Maldives, someone earning 50,000 MVR pays 8%, while someone earning 100,000 MVR pays 15%.',
  realWorldApplication: 'Most countries use progressive taxation to ensure wealthier individuals contribute more to public services.',
  unlockedBy: 'quest-tax-brackets',

---

#### 2. **Quest-Based Learning**

**Before Battle Briefing:**
```
MIRA DIRECTOR: "Agent, this case involves VAT fraud. 
Do you know what VAT is?"

[Player Choice]
‚Üí "Yes, teach me the basics" ‚Üí Tutorial popup
‚Üí "I know VAT well" ‚Üí Skip to advanced info
‚Üí "Let me try to explain" ‚Üí Quiz mode
```

**During Battle Education:**
- Combat log explains tax concepts
- Enemy abilities represent real tax evasion tactics
- Player abilities represent enforcement tools

**Example Combat:**
```
OFFSHORE ACCOUNTANT uses "Transfer Pricing Manipulation"!
üí° TIP: Transfer pricing is when companies charge themselves 
different prices to move profits to low-tax countries.

Your turn!
‚Üí Attack with "Tax Treaty Enforcement" (learn about tax treaties)
‚Üí Use "BEPS Action Plan" (learn about OECD initiatives)
‚Üí Flee (but miss learning opportunity)
```

**After Battle Debrief:**
```
VICTORY! You recovered 500 MVR in unpaid taxes.

üìö LESSON LEARNED:
Offshore tax evasion costs developing nations $200B annually.
The Maldives loses an estimated 15% of potential revenue to 
tax havens. This money could fund:
- 50 new schools
- 10 hospitals
- Infrastructure improvements

üèÜ ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: "Tax Justice Warrior"
üìñ NEW TERM UNLOCKED: "Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)"

## üéì Tax Law Teaching Methodology

### Pedagogical Approach

#### 1. **Scaffolded Learning**

**Bloom's Taxonomy Integration**:

```
Level 1 (Remember): Learn tax term definitions
  ‚Üì
Level 2 (Understand): Explain concepts to NPCs
  ‚Üì
Level 3 (Apply): Use knowledge in quests
  ‚Üì
Level 4 (Analyze): Break down complex cases
  ‚Üì
Level 5 (Evaluate): Make judgments about tax policies
  ‚Üì
Level 6 (Create): Design own tax system (endgame)
```

---

#### 2. **Active Learning Through Gameplay**

**Instead of**:
- Reading walls of text
- Passive information consumption

**Use**:
- Problem-solving (calculate taxes)
- Decision-making (legal vs illegal choices)
- Pattern recognition (spot evasion schemes)
- Critical thinking (evaluate policies)

---

#### 3. **Spaced Repetition**

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface LearningTracker {
  termId: string;
  exposure: number; // How many times encountered
  lastSeen: Date;
  nextReview: Date; // Spaced repetition algorithm
  mastery: number; // 0-100%
}
```

**In Game**:
- Re-encounter concepts in different contexts
- Review quizzes for older material
- Boss battles test comprehensive knowledge

---

#### 4. **Real-World Context**

**Maldives-Specific Content**:
```javascript
const maldivesTaxFacts = [
  {
    topic: "Tourism Tax",
    fact: "Tourism contributes ~28% of Maldives GDP",
    implication: "Why tourism tax evasion severely impacts the economy",
    questTieIn: "Island Resort Tax Raid"
  },
  {
    topic: "GST Implementation",
    fact: "Maldives introduced GST in 2011 at 3.5%, now 6-12%",
    implication: "How modern tax systems evolve",
    questTieIn: "The GST Chronicles"
  },
  {
    topic: "Small Economy Challenges",
    fact: "Maldives faces unique tax collection challenges due to geography",
    implication: "Why every rupee of tax revenue matters",
    questTieIn: "The Scattered Islands Audit"
  }
];
```

---

#### 5. **Ethical Frameworks**

**Moral Complexity in Quests**:

**Example Quest: "The Struggling Business Owner"**
```
SCENARIO:
A small business owner can't pay full taxes due to economic hardship.

OPTIONS:
1. Enforce full penalty (Rule of Law approach)
   ‚Üí Teaches: Tax compliance importance
   ‚Üí Consequence: Business closes, jobs lost
   
2. Offer payment plan (Compassionate approach)
   ‚Üí Teaches: Tax administration flexibility
   ‚Üí Consequence: Precedent set, possible abuse
   
3. Investigate deeper (Investigative approach)
   ‚Üí Teaches: Tax fraud vs legitimate hardship
   ‚Üí Consequence: Uncover larger evasion scheme OR confirm genuine hardship

LEARNING OUTCOME:
Tax enforcement isn't black and white. Understanding context
and applying judgment is crucial.
```
