# GitHub Setup Instructions

## ✅ Step 1: Local Repository Created
Your local git repository has been initialized and the first commit is complete!

```
✓ Git initialized
✓ All files added
✓ Initial commit created
```

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Using GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name:** `legends-of-revenue`
   - **Description:** `A medieval-themed RPG about tax enforcement in the Maldives - Play as a MIRA agent fighting tax evasion!`
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```powershell
gh repo create legends-of-revenue --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## 🔗 Step 3: Connect Local to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with instructions. Use these commands:

### If you created a new repository (most common):

```powershell
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/legends-of-revenue.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Example (replace with your actual username):
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/legends-of-revenue.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 📝 Step 4: Verify Upload

After pushing, visit your repository on GitHub:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/legends-of-revenue
```

You should see:
- ✅ All 73 files uploaded
- ✅ README.md displayed on the main page
- ✅ Complete documentation in the repository
- ✅ Full project structure

## 🔄 Future Updates

After the initial setup, use these commands to save changes:

```powershell
# See what files changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Quick Save Script:
```powershell
# Save everything with one command
git add . ; git commit -m "Update: $(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm')" ; git push
```

---

## 🏷️ Recommended Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```powershell
git commit -m "Add character import/export feature"
git commit -m "Fix: Combat consumables not working"
git commit -m "Update: Lore documents with new MIRA narrative"
git commit -m "Refactor: Character page layout optimization"

```

### "Authentication failed"

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Use token as password when prompted
