## 🌟 The Story

### In a World of Greed...

The **Maldives**—a tropical paradise transformed into a battleground. Economic chaos reigns. Tax evaders operate openly. Offshore accounts shelter billions. Shell companies multiply like cancer. The very fabric of society tears as public revenues vanish into criminal hands.

Schools go unfunded. Hospitals lack supplies. Infrastructure crumbles. All while luxury yachts populate offshore havens and corrupted businessmen toast their ill-gotten fortunes.

### One Agency Stands Against the Darkness

**MIRA** (Maldives Inland Revenue Authority) — the last bastion of economic justice. When others turned blind eyes to corruption, when officials accepted bribes, when accountants became criminals, MIRA remained incorruptible.

### You Are the Hero

Not a vigilante. Not a rebel. A **MIRA Agent**—sworn to uphold revenue law, trained to combat financial crime, empowered to bring evaders to justice.

Your badge represents hope. Your mission is righteous. Your enemy is greed itself.

## 👹 Enemies of Justice

### Tax Dodger Cat �
**Threat Level:** ⭐ Trivial

*"In every shadow, a coin-hoarding vermin awaits."*

These mangy creatures infest the darkest corners of the Maldives, attracted to the stench of hidden wealth and unpaid taxes. They build nests of stolen coins, symbolizing the thousands of small-time evaders who believe themselves too insignificant for MIRA to notice.

They are gravely mistaken.

**Combat Stats:**
- HP: 15
- Attack: 4
- Defense: 1
- Rewards: 15 XP, 8 Gold

---

### Petty Tax Evader 🏃
**Threat Level:** ⭐⭐ Minor

*"Desperation makes them dangerous."*

Former shopkeepers. Street vendors. Small business owners. Each thought they could outsmart the system. Each believed "just a little" evasion wouldn't hurt. Years of unpaid taxes transformed them from citizens into criminals.

Now, cornered and paranoid, they fight with the wild ferocity of those who know imprisonment awaits.

**Combat Stats:**
- HP: 25
- Attack: 6
- Defense: 3
- Special: Desperate Evasion (damages boost when wounded)
- Rewards: 30 XP, 20 Gold

---

### Offshore Accountant 💼
**Threat Level:** ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate

*"The pen truly is mightier than the sword—until MIRA arrives."*

Masters of deception. Architects of shell companies. These financial criminals speak in codes, operate from tropical fortresses, and weave networks so complex that justice itself becomes lost in the paperwork.

They've perfected the art of the legal loophole. They've memorized every tax haven regulation. They always have three escape routes planned.

But they didn't plan for you.

**Combat Stats:**
- HP: 20
- Attack: 7
- Defense: 2
- Special: Creates financial traps
- Rewards: 25 XP, 15 Gold

---

### Corrupted Businessman 🤵
**Threat Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Dangerous

*"Money can buy many things. But not immunity from justice."*

Designer suits. Luxury watches. Penthouse offices overlooking paradise—all bought with untaxed millions. These titans of fraud have corrupted officials, falsified records, and built empires on lies.

They believe themselves untouchable. Protected by armies of lawyers. Shielded by political connections. Too big to fail. Too rich to prosecute.

They are about to learn that no amount of wealth can stop MIRA's pursuit of justice.

**Combat Stats:**
- HP: 35
- Attack: 8
- Defense: 5
- Special: Shield Wall (enhanced legal protections)
- Rewards: 50 XP, 30 Gold

### Arim the Dragon 🐉
**Threat Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ LEGENDARY

*"The embodiment of greed. The curse made flesh. Your ultimate test."*

In the deepest vault, atop mountains of hoarded gold that reach toward the heavens, dwells an ancient evil: **Arim the Dragon**.

For millennia, this beast has slumbered on stolen wealth, growing impossibly large on the fortune of unpaid taxes. Every coin it touches becomes cursed with the taint of evasion. Every treasure in its hoard represents a future stolen from the people.

The dragon is more than a creature—it is a manifestation. The physical embodiment of greed itself. The living curse that afflicts all who would rob the public treasury.

To defeat Arim is not merely to slay a beast. It is to break the very curse of tax fraud that has plagued civilization since the first coin was minted.

**Combat Stats:**
- HP: ??? (Legendary)
- Attack: ??? (Devastating)
- Defense: ??? (Nearly Impenetrable)
- Special Abilities:
  - **Gold Flame Breath:** Incinerates the greedy
  - **Tax Shield:** Supernatural defense from legal loopholes
  - **Greed's Curse:** Weakens resolve with visions of wealth
- Rewards: ??? (Victory itself is the reward)

**Dragon's Taunt:**
> *"FOOLISH MORTAL! THIS GOLD IS MINE! TAXATION IS THEFT! YOU CANNOT DEFEAT GREED ITSELF!"*

### Business District 🏢
**Status:** Compromised | **Threat:** ⭐⭐ Minor

The first real test for any MIRA agent.

---

### Black Market Alley 🌑
**Status:** Criminal Hub | **Threat:** ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate

Where law fears to tread. In these shadowed passages, forbidden trades flourish. Cash changes hands without receipts. Goods move without manifests. Every transaction mocks taxation itself.

Only the brave dare enter. Only the skilled emerge.

---

### Border Checkpoint 🛂
**Status:** Infiltrated | **Threat:** ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate

The nation's gateway has become its weakness. Smugglers reign where guardians should stand. Contraband flows like rivers while those sworn to protect instead profit from corruption.

MIRA must reclaim this critical chokepoint.

### Offshore Haven 🏝️

### Dragon's Lair 🐉

But one hero must succeed. For the sake of the Maldives. For the sake of justice itself.
